Azure Synapse Analytics is an integrated analytics platform, which combines data warehousing, big data analytics, data integration, and visualization into a single environment. 




## Implement a Data Warehouse with Azure Synapse Analytics

A data warehouse is a centralized relational database that integrates data from one or more disparate sources. 

Data warehouses store current and historical data and are used for reporting and analysis of the data. 

Many organizations need to store and process data more quickly and easily at an increasing scale to meet business demand and respond to market shifts. In the past this has involved complex processes, using different technologies including Big Data technologies and data integration tools to ingest and prepare the data before presenting it to applications. 

Azure Synapse Analytics is designed to simplify this process with limitless scale through one experience. Massively Parallel Processing architecture at limitless scale
